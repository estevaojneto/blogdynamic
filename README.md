A theme originally used in https://0395.ch.

## Requirements
- A WordPress v6.x installation (theme compatibility with WP 5.x is theoretically possible but untested);
- A web server running PHP 8.0 and MySQL;
- Inspiration for writing!

## Nice-to-haves
- Classic Editor plugin. For the purposes of this theme Gutenberg is just an unnecessary overhead;

## How to Set Up
- Install the Theme however you want; you can just download a zip copy of this repository and upload it to your site if you want, or you can `git clone` this to your server theme folder (recommended);
- Create a new Page with the Template "BlogDynamic Main Page";
- Set that page as your Home page;
- Set a privacy policy, as most countries actually require your site to have one;
- All set! All your posts will be there.

For forks, I ask you to please keep these credits and just add your name to them. :)
