A theme originally used in https://0395.ch -> you can find the actual theme code in `/web/app/themes/blogdynamic`.

## Technologies Used
- WordPress Bedrock for local deploys and testing
- Bootstrap v5.2
- PHP 8.0
- WordPress v6.x (theme compatibility with WP 5.x is theoretically possible but untested).

## How to Set Up
- Install the Theme however you want; either copy the entire repository to your server or just install the theme by zipping the theme folder contents.
- Create a new Page with the Template "BlogDynamic Main Page".
- Set that page as your Home page.
- All set! All your posts will be there.
