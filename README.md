A theme originally used in https://0395.ch.

## Requirements
- A WordPress v6.x installation (theme compatibility with WP 5.x is theoretically possible but untested);
- A web server running PHP 8.0+ and MySQL;
- Inspiration for writing!

## How to Set Up
- Install the Theme however you want; you can just download a zip copy of this repository and upload it to your site if you want, or you can `git clone` this to your server theme folder (recommended);
- Create a new Page with the Template "BlogDynamic Main Page";
- That is all!
